PEPINO is a graphical PEer-to-Peer network INspectOr running on top of
Beernet, a structured overlay network using the Relaxed-Ring topology. The
goal is to monitor the network by detecting failures, and by observing the
messages sent between peers. A dynamic and self-organizing view of the network
is presented to the user, who can interacts with it to inject failures or send
messages in order to study the network protocols.

This is a reimplementation of PEPINO 0.2, which was the last one released
using P2PS. It is strongly based on the work of Donatien Grolaux, Raphael
Collet and Boriss Mejias.
