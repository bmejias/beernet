<h2>Transreal</h2>

<p>The TRANSREAL project is a proposal for a Flagship Research Pilot, at a 
European level, to catalyze a major qualitative advance in the relationship 
between human beings and the world's computing infrastructure, which we call 
<a href="real_world_computing.php">real-world computing</a>. By real-world 
computing we mean that the world's computing infrastructure will process 
complex real-world data to interact with human beings at a human level of 
sensory input/output and intellectual concepts. Real-world computing will 
provide full media interchangeability (real-time translation of human 
languages between textual, audio, and video forms). Real-world computing will 
extract knowledge from the vast body of raw digital content (text, audio, 
video) and use it to build creative solutions to problems specified by humans. 
Real-world computing will provide expert guidance in real time to human 
activities that require specialized knowledge.</p>

<h2>Further Reading</h2>

<p> This <a
href="../staticfiles/transreal/IntelligentSystemsFuture.pdf">presentation</a> 
gives you a short introduction to <em>intelligent systems</em>. On this site, 
we give a deeper view of our vision on <a 
href="real_world_computing">real-world computing</a>, <a 
href="resource_amplification.php">resource amplification</a> through elastic 
computing (depicted in Figure 1), and the space of <a 
href="machine_learning.php">machine learning</a> applications. During our 
visit at <a href="http://fosdem.org/2011">FOSDEM</a>, we used <a 
href="at_fosdem.php">this page</a> to introduce the vision of TRANSREAL, and 
to trigger informal discussion of the ideas to get feedback from the free 
software and open source community.
