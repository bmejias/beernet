Release Beernet 0.9 and departure presentation

<p> Today is my last day at work at <strong>UCLouvain</strong>, and to
celebrate it I am doing my last presentation about Beernet at the university
as part of the ICTEAM Young Researchers' Day. This is also a good opportunity
to do a <strong>new release</strong> including the last features of storing
data items using secrets to protect against updates. But fear not! I am
leaving the university but I will on developing Beernet. </p>
