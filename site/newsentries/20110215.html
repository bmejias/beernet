FOSDEM 2011

<p> Once again we attended FOSDEM. It was nice to see how scalable systems are
getting more and more interest from the community. There was a main track
dedicated to Cloud Computing, and a devroom dedicated to data analysis. We
also discussed many of the ideas of the <a href="transreal/">Transreal
	Initiative</a> getting interesting feedback from other developers. </p>
