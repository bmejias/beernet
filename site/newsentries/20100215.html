FOSDEM 2010

<p> We had a very good time at <a href="http://www.fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a> this
year. I'd like to thank all the people who attended to our <a
	href="http://www.fosdem.org/2010/schedule/events/beernet">Lightning
	Talk</a>. We got very good feedback. If you are looking for more
information about <strong>Beernet</strong>, we will soon release a new version
with full API documentation. If you want, <a href="contact.php">send me an
	email</a> and I'll let you know when Beernet is released.</p>
